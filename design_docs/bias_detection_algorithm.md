# Bias Detection Algorithm Design for Spectrum News

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a simplified bias detection algorithm that will classify news articles across the political spectrum. The algorithm will analyze article content to determine political leaning and reliability of sources.

## Classification Framework

### 1. Large Frame Classification
The primary classification will categorize articles into three main groups:
- **Left**: Articles with progressive/liberal perspectives
- **Center**: Articles with balanced or neutral perspectives
- **Right**: Articles with conservative perspectives

### 2. Detailed Classification Algorithm
The detailed algorithm will further classify articles into six subcategories:

#### Extreme Left/Right
**Detection criteria:**
- Use of inflammatory language
- Citations of extreme online communities
- References to conspiracy theories
- Highly emotional language
- Absence of opposing viewpoints
- Absolutist terminology

#### Moderate Left/Right
**Detection criteria:**
- Subtle favorable language toward left/right positions
- Balanced presentation but with clear leaning
- Inclusion of some opposing viewpoints, but with less emphasis
- Policy framing that aligns with traditional left/right perspectives
- Source selection that favors one side

#### Ideologically Center
**Detection criteria:**
- Balanced presentation of both left and right perspectives
- Maximum tipping point of 60%-40% in either direction
- Equal weight given to opposing viewpoints
- Neutral language in descriptions of policies and events
- Diverse source selection

#### Mechanically Neutral
**Detection criteria:**
- Rigid, report-style writing
- Focus on facts and numbers
- Minimal interpretive language
- Absence of policy recommendations
- Structured like intelligence or technical reports

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Text Analysis Techniques
- **Keyword Analysis**: Identify politically charged terms and their frequency
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine emotional tone toward political entities
- **Source Analysis**: Evaluate the political leaning of cited sources
- **Framing Analysis**: Identify how issues are contextualized

### 2. Cross Validation System
- Establish common themes shared by at least 5 articles
- Create consensus summaries based on basic facts agreed upon across sources
- Generate comparison charts between moderate left and moderate right articles
- Identify key issues for comparison: cause of incident, main event details, analysis perspectives

### 3. Source Reliability Validation
Weight sources based on:
- Established reputation
- Transparency of methodology
- History of corrections
- Diversity of perspectives
- Citation practices

## Technical Implementation (Simplified MVP)
For the initial version, we will implement a streamlined approach:

1. **Text Processing Pipeline**:
   - Tokenization and cleaning
   - Named entity recognition
   - Key phrase extraction
   - Sentiment scoring

2. **Classification Model**:
   - Rule-based scoring system for initial classification
   - Weighted scoring of political indicators
   - Threshold-based categorization

3. **Reliability Scoring**:
   - Pre-defined reliability scores for known sources
   - Domain reputation analysis
   - Citation and reference quality assessment

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning model training for improved accuracy
- User feedback incorporation
- Expanded source database with reliability metrics
- Advanced natural language processing for context understanding
- Historical bias tracking over time
